# P.P. Dash

This game was made as part of the Global Game Jam 2015 at chika-ba, Japan ([see entry](https://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/p-p-dash)).

It is a competitive rhythm game for 2 players controlling 2 kids playing Ring and run at the *Knock Hotel*. During a round, player 1 sets a rhythm by knocking on certain doors in a row, then player 2 must repeat the pattern, a la *Simon Says*. If player 2 repeats the pattern correctly, the game continue to the next round. Otherwise, he/she loses. For this reason, player 1 is a kind of mastermind and cannot lose, but it is possible to state that player 2 wins if he/she survives X rounds. Both players can also exchange roles when player 2 loses, and compare the number of rounds they survived at the end.
