# P.P. Dash

This game was made as part of the Global Game Jam 2015 at chika-ba, Japan ([see entry](https://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/p-p-dash)).

## Rules

It is a rhythm game for 2 players controlling 2 kids playing Ring and run at the *Knock Hotel*. During a round, player 1 sets a rhythm by knocking on certain doors in a row, then player 2 must repeat the pattern by opening the same doors, a la *Simon Says*. If player 2 repeats the pattern correctly, the game continue to the next round. Otherwise, the game ends.

It is possible to see the game either as cooperative or competitive:

* In cooperative mode, player 1 should make sure to knock a minimum number of doors, and must count on player 2 to repeat the pattern.

* In competitive mode, player 2 must repeat the patterns as many rounds as possible. When player 2 fails, both players exchange their roles. Players can then compare the number of rounds they passed.

## Start game

Open index.htm in a browser (with Javascript active).

* Click on the 1st line (ゲームをはじめる) to open the game page. Then click on the right button (スタート) to start the game.

* Click on the 2nd line (せつめいをみる) to read Japanese instructions.

### In-game

Click on the left button (ノック or あける) to knock (1st phase with the boy) or open (2nd phase with the girl) a door. If the button is focused, you can also just press Space or Enter.

## Context

The jam's theme was "What do we do now?", however this was only loosely followed and instead, all the games made in this location had the following constraint: make the game playable by people with impaired vision. The game meets this criterion by providing audio feedback from player 1's pattern to player 2 reproducing it. It also features very simple HTML to navigate in.

Unfortunately, a small audio desynchronization bug makes it difficult to keep the exact rhythm after a number of rounds, but the game remains playable overall.
